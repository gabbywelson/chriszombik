As of today, the amount of time that has passed since I left Shanghai is greater than the amount of time I lived in Shanghai. I know this because last summer it suddenly occurred to me that at some point this moment would come, so I did the math, and marked my calendar accordingly.

When I did that, I remember thinking that it seemed like this day, when it arrived, would feel incredibly significant. After all, during my time in Shanghai, it felt like I had spent my entire adulthood there. In a way, that really was the case: I moved to Shanghai just year after graduating college, and spent the heart of my twenties thereâ€”from age 23 to two weeks before my 28th birthday.

Back then, as far as I could tell, Shanghai simply *was* my life. The only thing I had to compare it to was the confused and dreamlike extended childhood from which I was abruptly ejected upon my graduation from college. Compared to that, my life in Shanghai was incredibly vivid. For the first time, I had unlimited autonomy over my time and finances, my diet and my living space. Every day was full of novelty and challenge. Every experience felt sink or swim. Every conversation and menu and mall directory was a puzzle. It was stimulating and exciting in the extreme.

My current life epoch, whose beginning coincided almost exactly with the start of the pandemic, has been rather different. The autonomy remains but the novelty is gone. The challenges are less fun and far more threatening. There is very little stimulating about being an American in America, which might explain why people are always looking at their phones.

Last summer, the realization that my current rather mundane life epoch would soon surpass in length what had felt like an entire self-contained lifetime in Shanghai seemed quite profound. How could a whole lifetime's worth of time have passed so quickly, with so few vivid new memories being formed, and so little seeming to have changed?

However, now that the day has arrived, it honestly doesn't feel particularly profound at all. Certainly I find it amusing, a factoid worth pointing out in the vein of the line about Cleopatra living closer to the Moon landing than to the construction of the Pyramids. People find the passage of time perennially interesting, and perennially profound.

But, is it actually profound? Perhaps the profound thing here is the lack of profundity. At one time, Shanghai felt like an entire self-contained life. Now it's just one more epoch of my life, a well-defined four-year stretch not unlike elementary school, middle school, high school, college, and these last four years post-Shanghai. That lack of profundity, that transmutation from "key formative experience of my adult life" into "just one of many comparable things that has happened to me" is a function of time.

That is my only takeaway here. As time passes, it changes how I think about the past. Perhaps this can provide a source of hope. Perhaps it means that the current "dull" epoch, in which I currently feel mired, which feels like it has always existed and will always exist, will one day seem to an older version of me like some sort of nostalgic time, a period of struggle, a training montage, the moment when I finally laid it all on the line to make my dreams come true.

Perhaps. I'd like to hope so. At any rate, I don't intend to leave it to chance.
