Introduction

I want to say right at the top that I am not committing to doing one blog post every single week in 2023, lol.

However, in the spirit of getting as many of these posts up as possible, I am going to try to make more of them than I did last year, and consequently they will be shorter and less heavily edited in general. For out of context, I am dictating this into my computer, which I hope will put a limit on how much time I can spend fiddling with and composing these posts.

Yearly Themes

I won't go into detail explaining what a yearly theme is because there are lots of people who have done that better, but in very brief: a yearly theme is an alternative to a New Year's resolution. The latter is a concrete goal you set, which consequently is possible (and some would even say likely) to fail. In contrast, a yearly theme cannot be failed because it is more of an abstract guide for action, something to keep in mind as you make choices throughout the year to channel your energies more in the direction you want to go. A resolution could be “lose 20 pounds.” A theme would be “year of health.”

For 2023, I have chosen the theme "the year of new". There are several reasons this is a good theme for me right now. Mainly, there are several “big” new things in 2023 that I will definitely do, i.e. that are already on my calendar or to which I am already committed. Declaring 2023 to be the “year of new” helps me to remember that those things are important, even if they are not on the immediate horizon, and keep them in a central place in my life. Secondarily, the “year of new” makes sense because it will encourage me to do another thing that's important to me in 2023 which is to try new things, to get out of my comfort zone, to adopt new habits, etc. A good theme should be flexible and malleable and applicable in a variety of different contexts. I think “year of new” works nicely for this.

Weekly Themes??

2023 has the incredible feature of starting on a Sunday. Being able to start January directly on a clean calendar week really works for my brain as a person who prefers to sit down and make plans that fit into regularly shaped blocks of time. Furthermore, considering that a year has (roughly) 52 weeks in it, it occurs to me that I have a great opportunity here to look ahead at each week and think more clearly than ever about what I want that week to be about.

Hence, for the first week of 2023, I am going to declare an additional miniature weekly theme. Will this become a regular feature? Who knows. But I think it's worth trying!

With my “year of new” idea, I aim to simultaneously balance following through on the "big" new projects on my docket with a mindset of taking on totally new things that are either minor, or came up suddenly, or otherwise aren't on my radar yet. To this end, I want these blog posts to serve as a sort of journal, where I record at the start of the week a few new things that I hope or expect to do. At the end of the week, I should be able to review and see at a glance: did I do the new things I set out to do? Did I encounter some obstacles, or overplan?

This appeals to me because, considering the year has 52 weeks, even at a relaxed pace it feels like I should be able to do 52 new things. It would obviously be impossible to do 52 new things in one week, but spreading them out over the year would seem to make them almost trivially achievable. And as I am a person who tends to bite off more than he can chew, this may be an especially useful time management strategy for me.

2023, Week 1

Henceforth let it be known that the first week of 2023 shall be the Week of New Glasses.

There's no trick to this one. I just need new glasses.

I actually got an updated prescription back in August, but procrastinated on getting new glasses because my old ones were still fine and I wasn't satisfied with any of the frames I found (and I searched HARD). So this week I’m gonna suck it up and go get glasses. (This is especially salient now because the old glasses I had been using with my previous year’s prescription recently broke.)

I'm tempted to commit to more than this, but I already know that would be setting myself up to fail. The entire point of setting weekly themes is to bite off only as much as I can chew, and then actually chew it. I will do plenty of other stuff this week (I have work, after all!) but this is the one thing I’ve chosen to guide me to live up to my yearly theme during the next 7 days.

And so with that, let’s get to it!

新年快乐！Happy New Year!
