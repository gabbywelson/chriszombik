Short update here. My Week 1 subtheme was New: Glasses. I was busy with work but did manage to go to Costco near the end of the week, get a new prescription, order contacts, and pick out frames I liked. I was told my order would be ready in 1-2 weeks. 

Things rolled over into Week 2. A bunch of stuff happened I won’t write about here. Good stuff. New stuff. But a bunch. Since I hadn’t finished the glasses project I declared Week 2 to be a continuation of the New: Glasses subtheme.

Anyway, turns out the glasses were ready in 5 days. I picked them up this past Thursday. They’re perfect. I can see. Mission accomplished!
