Short update just to mark this milestone. On returning to Boston I wanted to try and bring some of the magic I had experienced on vacation back home with me. The ways in which I did and did not accomplish this were very instructive. I don’t wish to go deep into detail but my week 4 subtheme was New: Phase of My Career. I would say that I very much lived up to this, because…

I finished my novel! I did it. I really did it. After 3+ years working on and off, never losing hope, never giving up on my vision for this story, through many disruptions and changes of plan, I finished drafting the Epilogue yesterday (January 28, 2023) and printed the entire thing out. This is probably the proudest I have ever been of anything I’ve ever done.

Of course, it isn’t done. Now that I have printed it out, I have to read it. I have no idea how long that will take or what I will experience while doing it. But it needs to be done. And then changes—some big, many small—will need to be made. And THEN I will really have something to be proud of.
