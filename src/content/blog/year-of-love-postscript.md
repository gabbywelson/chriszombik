Looking back at my blog posts from last year, I realize that I didn't write anything since July.

This sort of thing tends to happen with amateur blogs, for whatever reason. But rest assured, dear reader, that even though I stopped writing about it publicly, I did not give up on my 2022 yearly theme halfway through the year.

In fact, I would say that the Year of Self Love was a resounding success.

It would be difficult to succinctly describe why this was the case. You will have to take my word for it. Mainly, I made huge strides in improving my mental health thanks to dedicated therapists and effective medications. Also, I do yoga now. Also also, I have learned to utilize mindfulness to, if not achieve more, then at least feel better about what I am achieving. Also^3 my understanding of and attitude towards other people has improved. Also^4, my self-image and my relationship to my past mistakes has become much healthier. And so on and so forth.

It is difficult to identify any clear or transferable takeaways from this experience. I would say, go to therapy mainly. Attend an 8-week mindfulness course. Get a bad case of Covid and, while it’s dissolving the grey matter in your brain, have a spiritual experience that redefines how you value your life. You know, simple stuff.

One thing I think is actionable is something called a “value sort” exercise. I hope to make a post about this at some point in 2023 because I found it genuinely (no pun intended) valuable.

But yeah, hey, 2022, weird year for the world, but all in all a pretty good one for me. If nothing else, the hard work I did last year has set the stage for 2023 to be a great year!
