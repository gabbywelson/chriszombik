I’m back home in Boston. As the snow falls outside my window, here’s a quick look back on some things I did in the second half of my week in SF!

LinkedIn
I visited the campus of noted social network LinkedIn with my host, a LinkedIn employee. This was my first true “big tech company” office visit (I visited Google NYC in undergrad but we were only there for like an hour and didn’t get to take advantage of any of the amenities). I came away with a very good impression. I was treated to free breakfast, lunch, and coffee, all of which were tasty and ostensibly nutritious.

After a quick tour of a surprisingly empty office, I got to take advantage of a comfortable, quiet (sort of) work environment, where I felt encouraged to be productive, but in a humane way. It vaguely reminded me of the student center at my college.

I will say, I was stunned by how many people I saw taking Zoom meetings. It’s cliche to say that software companies have too many meetings. But the quantity—specifically of online video call meetings—was truly upsetting. As a person who is self-employed, I simply cannot relate to this as a strategy for getting work done. But hey, it’s 2023. If your corporation doesn’t employ this kind of decentralized, flexible work environment, you aren’t keeping up with the times.

Lazy Bear

This is two Michelin star restaurant in SF serving what I guess you would call “California cuisine.” A restaurant of this caliber is hard to get a reservation at and definitely not cheap. A huge thank you to my generous hosts for getting us in and treating me!
I have been to a Michelin star restaurant once before, and found it not particularly memorable (except for the cost). Lazy Bear was totally different. It feels impossible to say what the best “meal” of my life has been, but this was easily the best restaurant experience of my life (and it wasn’t close). The food was better than exceptional—it was perfect. The service was surprisingly casual and fun. The sign of a good dining experience is, as I walk out, thinking to myself “I can’t wait to come back here!” Lazy Bear meets this standard with ease.

One of the delightful details was that we were provided a little notebook and golf pencil to take notes on the courses. As the meal wore on and the wine pairing took effect, my notes devolved from serious and detailed to basically memes. I kept the notebook as a souvenir, as I imagine is intended.

Wursthall/Wunderbar

Two culinary experiences in one location, by noted food guy J. Kenji López-Alt. Wursthall is an excellent… I guess you’d call it German-fusion restaurant? We had spätzle and bratwurst on rolls, but also hot Korean fried chicken? That should give you an idea of the vibe. Downstairs is Wunderbar, a speakeasy cocktail bar that was honestly just really really good, no notes.

Little Star Pizza

Nothing complicated here, just stellar (heh) deep dish pizza. I had the Little Star signature pie at my friend’s recommendation. As I am accustomed to e.g. sausage or pepperoni-bearing pies at Uno and similar, I wasn’t convinced this vegetarian pie would rise to my standard. I was way wrong. The crust, sauce, cheese—everything was exquisite. I think the pizza actually benefited from not having any meat, as it was less greasy than I’m used to and thus the other ingredients were even more able to shine (heh).

SF Barcades

After Little Star we went for a walk down Divisadero. We poked our heads into Emporium but it was too crowded so we headed on to the Castro and eventually ducked into Detour. The vibes here were immaculate. I encountered the second Killer Queen machine of the week (and of my life—first was at the LinkedIn office a few days earlier, lol), saw people playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on the bar big screen, and got a lesson from a random guy about a couple machines that are apparently totally unique to this bar—like, custom-made by hobbyists, as opposed to the restored classic machines at Musée Mécanique.

Hot Cookie

I insisted on stopping by here as a pilgrimage of sorts after my first experience in May 2021. Located in the heart of the Castro, Hot Cookie’s calling card is the unambiguously-named Penis Cookie. The penis cookie is a… generously-proportioned chocolate-covered macaroon-style coconut cookie. It comes in two flavors; I got dark chocolate. Obviously it’s funny that the cookie is shaped like a dick, but it truly has no business being as delicious as it is.
Similarly to the Archimedes Banya, there is something deeply empowering, even soothing, about confronting human sexuality in such a public and non-erotic context. I would not describe American culture as particularly sex positive, but SF is probably the most sex positive place in America that I’ve been. The walls of Hot Cookie are covered with hundreds of Polaroid printouts of mostly-naked people wearing Hot Cookie-branded underwear, for example. I find this deeply refreshing and good for my mental health.
Conclusion: I had an incredible time in California and left feeling very empowered to seek out and do more “fun” things in the place where I actually live. Obviously I don’t have the time or money to go this hard every week. But there is so much I have yet to discover in Boston, and I know it’s out there, waiting for me, if I just get to looking.
