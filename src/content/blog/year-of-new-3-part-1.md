I’m traveling in San Francisco this week! That means that while I have some urgent-feeling work-related newness on the docket, in fact this week is all about new experiences. I feel like I lived an entire year in the past three days, and I’m still here another four.

Hence I am declaring this retroactively to be the Week of New: Bay Area Experiences. Here are some I have done and would recommend:

Archimedes Banya, a Russian bathhouse.

It felt pretty much exactly like what I understand of ancient Roman bathhouses. Hot, warm, and cold pools, a selection of saunas and steam rooms. Oh, and at least half the people were nude.

Nudity. I was told to expect this going in, but because I wasn’t sure what the vibe would be I wore a bathing suit. The place is co-ed, which you might think would cause problems but turned out to be a complete non-issue. There was nothing either sexy or uncomfortable about it.  Everyone was completely calm and happy and beautiful, There is something very democratic and equalizing about the nudity that 

I found utterly spiritual. Next time I will absolutely go nude.

Smuggler’s Cove, a tiki bar. 

I learned this weekend that apparently tiki bars are original to San Francisco. This seems to be a particularly excellent one, with over 1,000 rums on offer and thematic decor that made me feel like I was inside a nautical-Polynesian I Spy scene. 
I had the best Mai Tai of my life. If you want to make it yourself at home they have their own tiki mixology book.
House of Prime Rib, a prime rib restaurant.

No false advertising here, folks. They sure do have prime rib. The aesthetic is a familiar yet ambiguous early-mid 20th century “American restaurant” style that really works for me. The service was friendly and fun. The food was exactly what you expect—this is not a deep menu. Unless you opt for the fish over the beef, your only choices are which sides you want and how thick to carve the meat.
We were too stuffed to get anythin, but there was an exquisite menu of classic desserts—cheesecake, creme brulee, etc. I would aim to go with a bigger appetite next time so I can check these out.

Muir Woods National Monument, one of the last remaining ancient coast redwood forests.

This was another spiritual experience. Impossible to convey in words but I’ll try: big trees make human feel small. I spent a lot of time craning my neck up at these skyscraper-tall trees. It’s quite something.

The Parks Service really put their backs into explaining the history of the place, particularly to illustrate how this incredible site is only even still here because of conservationist action over a century ago. The black-and-white photos of fin de siecle loggers cutting down trees older than the English language just to make a quick buck never ceases to strike a chord with me.
Northern California has recently been on the receiving end of a so-called “atmospheric river” which has dumped a massive—like truly massive, and the infrastructure here is not built for it—amount of rain over the past month or so. That’s good news for lessening the years-long California drought! But it meant large parts of the trail we wanted to take were closed, and parts of what was open were super wet and muddy. I did not have appropriate footwear, and ended up scoring some pretty sweet Muir Woods socks at the gift shop as a result.

Oh, and we got in for free because it was MLK Jr. Day! Nothing makes me feel more in touch with—and in favor of—America than visiting our National Parks.

Museé Mécanique, a museum of restored and (mostly) functional coin-op amusements through the years.

Another place that defies concise explanation. There are several sections. There are very old wood-and-brass machines with all sorts of silly gags that really make you appreciate how easily amused people were before the invention of television. There is another section with air hockey and familiar arcade games. And there is a section with retro video arcade games, some of which I saw in my 90s childhood, others that are likely from my parents’ childhood.

This was also free, a la an arcade. You just walk in, get some quarters from the change machine, and go to town for like an hour and a half. My friend said it’s known as a great date spot, and I highly recommend it for this purpose.

Any of these would be the highlight of an ordinary week. Packing them all into basically two days has scrambled my brain in just the best possible way. I’m back to my typical work schedule as of today, but I can’t help thinking that I won’t be able to look at things the same anymore. Thus the Year of New continues apace.
