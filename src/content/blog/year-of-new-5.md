Looking ahead to the next week, with the novel “done,” we are faced with a (very good) dilemma: What now?

Obviously I have my paying job, the memoir project, which can take easily 5 hours per day. This feels like the top priority.
I also need to begin the process of novel editing. This will entail developing a process for novel editing.
Everything else is secondary to these two goals.

But just because something is secondary doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing. In particular I would really like to try and push forward on some new social connections:

I’d like to finally go on a date with someone I’ve been talking to on Hinge.
And I’d like to start more proactively looking for the kinds of groups or activities that appeal to me on e.g. Meetup.
Everything else beyond THIS is tertiary and not likely to get major attention. There are so many things I COULD do. But most of them should be actively avoided because they are distractions from these much more impactful goals.

So this is a perfect week for the Year of New. I guess we can dub this weekly subtheme New: Normal. Kind of redundant and maybe not informative, but it feels significant to me, and I’m the person this is all for so that’s all that matters.
