A story about family, duty, ambition, and magic, set against a backdrop of colonialism, revolution, and war. Epic fantasy in an original world, inspired by early modernity and the French Revolution. Points of interest include ancestral memory-constructs, clairvoyant sentient trees, inscrutable elemental spirits, adolescent fairytale giants, friendly saber-tooth tigers, and an improbable industrial revolution.
